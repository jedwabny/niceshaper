<h1>Install syntax highlighting in popular text editors</h1>

NiceShaper package includes a syntax highlighting files for popular text editors.
<p>
Vim and Midnight Commander (mcedit) are supported. However, Vim support is much better, even enables some syntax checking.

<h2>Vim</h2>

Installation of syntax highlighting for root user can be achieved by copying the editors/vim/niceshaper.vim file into the /root/.vim/syntax/ directory. If the /root/.vim/syntax/ directory doesn't exist, it needs to be created manually. Then in order to register a new configuration file type, there is needed to add the following rules into the /root/.vimrc file: 

<div class="boxExample">
	:syntax on<br>
	autocmd BufNewFile,BufRead *niceshaper*/*.conf set filetype=niceshaper
</div>

Thanks to this rules, syntax highlighting is enabled for all of text files with the ".conf" extension, placed within the path that contains the "niceshaper" word.


<h2>Midnight Commander - mcedit</h2>

In the case of mcedit, there is disadvantage of syntax highlighting installation for the user, thus shared installation is recommended. Shared installation can be achieved by copying the editors/mc/niceshaper.syntax into the /usr/share/mc/syntax/ directory.
<p>
Finally, the Syntax file contained within this directory needs to be appended with the following rules:

<div class="boxExample">
	file .\*niceshaper.\*\\.conf$ NiceShaper\sconfiguration ^#\sNiceShaper<br>
	include niceshaper.syntax
</div>

New rules have to be inserted before the last rules which already exist at the end of the Syntax file. It means before:

<div class="boxExample">
	file .\* unknown<br>
	include unknown.syntax
</div>

Syntax highlighting works for files with the ".conf" extension placed within the path that contains the "niceshaper" word or contains '# NiceShaper' at first line.
<p>
Warning! After upgrade of the Midnight Commander package, it could be needed to redo this installation.
